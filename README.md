# Sublime Text Bépo keymap

Remapping of Sublime vintage mode keymap to use a bépo keyboard layout.

## Use
Just copy the content of the `Default (Linux).sublime-keymap` in you own user keymap file. Customize to your own needs.

## New keymap


- The motion key stays on the same physical keys. They are now mapped to `c`-`t`-`s`-`r`. 
- `C`/`R` are used to move the cursor to the screen top/bottom
- `S`/`T` are used to move to the next/previous tab
- `h` is used to replace a character (instead of `r`). `H` is `R`
- `l` is "replace" (instead of `c`)
- `L` is replace until the end of line (instead of `C`)
- `j`/`J` are "move to character", forward and backward (instead of t/T)
- `k` is used to "substitute" instead of `s`. `K` is `S`.
- `é` is used instead of `w` to move to the end of a word or to select a word
- `«` and `»` are used as `<` `>`


## Caveat
Tested with Sublime Text 2 on linux. Some modifications might be necessary to use with other platforms of Sublime Text 3.
